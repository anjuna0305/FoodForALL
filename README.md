# FoodForALL
The `“FoodForAll”` is a web-based application where charitable communities and 
organizations around the island get a space to showcase their events to the public. Once an 
organization gets registered, it can get the necessary cash donations and volunteers for 
preparing meals depending on their requirements. In addition to that, these organizations can 
get a verified list of needy people through the connection we established with the area 
coordinators for selected areas, who are known as “the Grama Niladari”.

## Our goal
Our main goal is to establish a web-based platform for organizations that are willing to 
contribute food to the needy so that they can plan their voluntary activities in an effective and 
appealing manner. To facilitate that goal our proposed solution will create a place where those 
who are willing to engage with volunteering and donations can easily register and engage in 
the selected charity event.
